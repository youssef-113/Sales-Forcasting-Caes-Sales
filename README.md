## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Data Collection and Cleaning
- Collected car sales data with features including:
  - Car details (make, model, engine, transmission, etc.)
  - Customer information (gender, annual income)
  - Sales information (price, date, dealer details)
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing
- Created a clean dataset for analysis

### Milestone 2: Data Analysis and Visualization
- Conducted exploratory data analysis
- Created interactive dashboards
- Visualized sales trends and patterns
- Analyzed relationships between features
- Generated insights for business decisions

### Milestone 3: Model Development and Optimization
- Developed multiple forecasting models:
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - XGBoost
  - Decision Tree
- Performed feature engineering
- Optimized model parameters
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - R² (R-squared)
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
  - RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
- Selected Random Forest as the best performing model

### Milestone 4: Deployment
- Developed a Streamlit frontend with:
  - User-friendly interface
  - Real-time predictions
  - Visual feedback
  - Error handling
-Mlflow 

## Features

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r Milestone4/deployment/requirements.txt
```

4. Run the application:
```bash
# Start the backend
cd Milestone4/deployment/backend
python main.py

# Start the frontend (in a new terminal)
cd Milestone4/deployment/frontend
streamlit run app.py
```

## API Documentation
Once the backend is running, access the API documentation at:
- Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs
- ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc
